## Features

- Monitor multiple streamers and auto-record when they go live
- Web UI for managing streamers, recordings, and post-processing
- **Streamer Finder**: discover streamers via [camgirlfinder.net](https://camgirlfinder.net), supporting:
  - Face search: upload an image, auto-detect a face, and find similar streamers
  - Name search: search by username keyword
  - One-click add to recording list directly from result cards
  - Launch a similar-face search from any streamer card
- **HLS Relay**: proxy a streamer's live stream to any player without recording — open `/stream/{modelname}` to start automatically; supports multiple simultaneous clients
- Supports split network proxies: configure Stripchat API proxy and CDN chunk proxy separately
- Supports configurable Stripchat mirror site (replaces `stripchat.com` in requests with your mirror domain)
- **Mouflon HLS decryption**: manage `pkey → pdkey` key pairs for decrypting Stripchat's encrypted HLS segment filenames; supports automatic key sync from a configured URL
- Configurable post-processing pipeline with pluggable modules:
  - **contact_sheet** — generates a tiled preview image with timestamps
  - **filter_short** — deletes recordings below a minimum duration
  - **notify_discord** — sends recording info and cover image to a Discord Webhook
  - **notify_telegram** — sends recording info, cover image, and video via MTProto (supports files >2 GB, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy)
- Disk space monitoring on the recordings page, with a warning highlight when less than 5 GB remains
- Dual runtime: Tauri desktop app or headless server accessible via browser
- Real-time UI updates via Server-Sent Events with multi-client sync
- Dark/light mode following system theme
- Custom UI language support, see [Custom Locale Guide](docs/custom-locale.en.md)

## Quick Start (Docker)

### docker-compose (recommended)

```yaml
services:
  stripchat-recorder:
    image: chantrail/stripchat-recorder:latest
    container_name: stripchat-recorder
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
      # - LANGUAGE=en-US  # Set interface language: zh-CN (default) or en-US
      # - PORT=3030        # Set server port (default: 3030)
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-3030}:${PORT:-3030}"
    volumes:
      - ./data/logs:/app/stripchat-recorder/logs
      - ./data/recordings:/app/stripchat-recorder/recordings
      - ./data/modules:/app/stripchat-recorder/modules
      - ./data/config:/app/stripchat-recorder/config
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:3030` in your browser.

The Docker image runs in Server mode by default (port 3030). Configuration is written to the mounted `config/settings.json`.

### Key Settings

The following options are available in the Web UI under Settings:

| Setting                        | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Output directory               | Path where recordings are saved                                             |
| Max concurrent                 | Maximum number of simultaneous recordings; `0` means unlimited             |
| Poll interval                  | How often to check if a streamer is live (seconds), range 10–300           |
| Merge format                   | Format for auto-merging segments after recording: `mp4` (default), `mkv`, `ts` |
| Auto-record                    | Whether newly added streamers have auto-record enabled by default           |
| Max post-process tmp dir (GB)  | Size limit for temporary files created by post-processing modules; oldest files are deleted when exceeded; `0` means unlimited, default 50 GB |

### Network Proxies and Mirror

In the settings page under "Network", you can configure:

Stripchat mirror project: <https://github.com/ChanTrail/StripchatMirror>

1. API Proxy: used for Stripchat API access; if a mirror is also set, mirror requests go through this proxy.
2. CDN Proxy: used for downloading live stream chunks; can be configured independently from the API proxy.
3. Stripchat Mirror: replaces `stripchat.com` in requests with your mirror domain.

### Mouflon HLS Decryption Keys

Stripchat encrypts HLS segment filenames (the Mouflon system). If recordings fail to download segments, add the corresponding `pkey → pdkey` key pairs in Settings under "Mouflon Decryption Keys". Keys can be obtained from community channels.

You can also configure a "Sync URL" and optional "Sync Token" to automatically pull the latest keys from a specified URL.

### HLS Relay

In Server mode, you can stream any streamer's live broadcast directly to a player without adding them to the recording list:

```
http://localhost:3030/stream/{modelname}
```

The relay starts automatically on first access and supports multiple simultaneous clients on the same stream. The "Relay" page in the Web UI shows all active sessions with their state, connection count, and uptime.

### docker run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name stripchat-recorder \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -e LANGUAGE=en-US \
  -e PORT=3030 \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -v ./data/logs:/app/stripchat-recorder/logs \
  -v ./data/recordings:/app/stripchat-recorder/recordings \
  -v ./data/modules:/app/stripchat-recorder/modules \
  -v ./data/config:/app/stripchat-recorder/config \
  chantrail/stripchat-recorder:latest
```

## Post-processing Modules

Modules are standalone executables implementing a simple protocol. They receive input via environment variables and communicate with the host via stdout.

### Built-in Modules

| Module            | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `contact_sheet`   | Extracts frames at a configurable interval and tiles them into a preview image |
| `filter_short`    | Deletes recordings shorter than a configurable minimum duration                |
| `notify_discord`  | Sends recording info and cover image to a Discord Webhook                      |
| `notify_telegram` | Sends recording info, cover image, and video to Telegram via MTProto (supports files >2 GB, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy) |

Custom modules placed in the `modules` volume directory are discovered automatically and will not be overwritten when the container restarts. See the [Module Development Guide](docs/module-development.en.md) for details.

## Building from Source

**Prerequisites:** Rust, Node.js (LTS), ffmpeg

### First-launch Setup

When running the binary directly, if no run mode has been configured in `config/settings.json`, an interactive TUI will guide you through setup:

1. Select UI language (Chinese / English)
2. Select run mode (Desktop / Server)
3. If Server mode, enter the listen port (default 3030)

The choices are saved to `config/settings.json` and the TUI will not appear again on subsequent launches.

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend + Tauri binary
npm run build
npx tauri build --no-bundle

# Build post-processing modules
for dir in modules/*/; do
  [ -f "$dir/Cargo.toml" ] && cargo build --manifest-path "$dir/Cargo.toml" --release --bins
done
```

### Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t chantrail/stripchat-recorder .
```

## Tech Stack
